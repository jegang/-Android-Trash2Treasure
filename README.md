# Android-Project-TrashToTreasure

Our Application is based on the famous quote "One man's trash is another man's treasure". We all have some items that we don't need any more like old mobiles, clothes, furniture, households. Instead of throwing them away take a pic of your item and post it in our application. The person near you may contact you to pick it up. It's win-win application, your trash goes away and some needy people may use it. Let's SAVE the environment.
